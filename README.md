# TuckermansBookoftheArtistsDataset
This subset of the Tenth Street Studio Building Lifespan Dataset measures the
degree to which Henry T. Tuckerman includes tenants of the Tenth Street Studio Builindg in his Book of the Artists: American Artist Life, Comprising Biographical and Critical
Sketches of American Artists: Preceded by an Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of Art in
America (New York: G. P. Putnam &amp; Son, 1867), a revision of an earlier book, Artist-life; or, Sketches of American painters
(1847). Using the first ten years of the Studio Building Lifespan data, this
subset adds more granular detail about tenants’ registered occupations, including
an unfiltered view of how they registered in the city directory and assigning each of
them a code with a more general category of labor (1 painter or sculptor, 2
architect, 3 other profession, 0 building staff). The dataset then identifies if a tenant
is included in Book of the Artists (0 for no, 1 for yes). This dataset informs the Mining @ Tenth Street Project and an article about the Tenth Street Studio Building, published by Panorama: Journal of the Historians of American Art, see: Mary Okin with Celie Mitchard, “From Center to Periphery: The Lifespan of New York City’s Tenth Street Studio Building and the Canon of American Art,” Panorama: Journal of the Association of Historians of American Art 8, no. 2 (Fall 2022), https://doi.org/10.24926/24716839.1539.
